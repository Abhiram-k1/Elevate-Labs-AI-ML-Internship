1. What are the different types of missing data?
MCAR (Missing Completely at Random), MAR (Missing at Random), and MNAR (Missing Not at Random).

2. How do you handle categorical variables?
Use Label Encoding for ordinal data and One-Hot Encoding for nominal data.

3. What is the difference between normalization and standardization?
Normalization scales data between 0 and 1, while Standardization centers data around mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

4. How do you detect outliers?
Use boxplots, Z-score, or IQR method to identify extreme values.

5. Why is preprocessing important in ML?
It improves data quality, ensures compatibility with models, and enhances performance.

6. What is one-hot encoding vs label encoding?
Label Encoding assigns integers; One-Hot Encoding creates binary columns for each category.

7. How do you handle data imbalance?
Use oversampling (e.g., SMOTE), undersampling, or class weighting methods.

8. Can preprocessing affect model accuracy?
Yes, it significantly improves model accuracy and reliability.
