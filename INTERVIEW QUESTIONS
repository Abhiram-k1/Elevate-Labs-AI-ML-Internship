1. What are the different types of missing data?
MCAR (Missing Completely at Random), MAR (Missing at Random), and MNAR (Missing Not at Random).

2. How do you handle categorical variables?
Use Label Encoding for ordinal data and One-Hot Encoding for nominal data.

3. What is the difference between normalization and standardization?
Normalization scales data between 0 and 1, while Standardization centers data around mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

4. How do you detect outliers?
Use boxplots, Z-score, or IQR method to identify extreme values.

5. Why is preprocessing important in ML?
It improves data quality, ensures compatibility with models, and enhances performance.

6. What is one-hot encoding vs label encoding?
Label Encoding assigns integers; One-Hot Encoding creates binary columns for each category.

7. How do you handle data imbalance?
Use oversampling (e.g., SMOTE), undersampling, or class weighting methods.

8. Can preprocessing affect model accuracy?
Yes, it significantly improves model accuracy and reliability.

9. What is the purpose of EDA?
To understand the dataset's structure, spot anomalies, find patterns, and generate hypotheses for further analysis.

10. How do boxplots help in understanding a dataset?
Boxplots show data distribution, detect outliers, and highlight the median and quartiles.

11. What is correlation and why is it useful?
Correlation measures the relationship between variables, helping identify dependencies useful for feature selection.

12. How do you detect skewness in data?
By checking skewness value using df.skew() or visually using histograms or KDE plots.

13. What is multicollinearity?
It refers to high correlation between independent variables, which can affect model performance and interpretation.

14. What tools do you use for EDA?
Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sweetviz, and Plotly.

15. Can you explain a time when EDA helped you find a problem?
In a Titanic dataset, EDA revealed missing age values and class imbalance, guiding preprocessing steps.

16. What is the role of visualization in ML?
Visualization simplifies complex data, helps detect patterns, and supports informed decision-making in model building.
